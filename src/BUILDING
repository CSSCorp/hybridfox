Developing Elasticfox
---------------------

For a background on developing Firefox extensions see

  http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Extensions
 
If this is your first extension, the very least you should do is setup your
environment to make your life easier.

  http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Setting_up_extension_development_environment 

The Elasticfox source is set up to make testing without building easy. The
chrome.manifest file points Firefox at your local filesystem, not at the
xpi package contents (this is adjusted at build time). Using the directions
described in the above link, you can tell Firefox to run the extension from
source.

Essentially:

 - Create a developr profile for Firefox if you don't want to tread all over your
   default profile.

   firefox -no-remote -p Developer

 - In your Developer profile's extension directory, create a file named for the
   Elasticfox extension GUID. Put inside it the path to the Elasticfox src
   directory.

   $ echo "$HOME/coding/elasticfox/trunk/src" > YOUR_FIREFOX_PROFILE/extensions/\{2204c510-88f3-11db-b606-0800200c9a66\} 

 - Restart Firefox and navigate to 

     chrome://ec2ui/content/ec2ui_main_window.xul 


Building
--------

Building Elasticfox is quite straight-forward. It can be done on *NIX, Mac OS X and Windows (with Cygwin).

Prerequisites:

 - java, specifically the jar command
 - JAVA_HOME should be set to the base Java install directory
 
Building:

 - run ./make.sh
 
The make script will run the build.sh and package.sh scripts. These will create
a dist directory which contains the .xpi and .zip files for distribution.
