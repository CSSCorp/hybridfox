		<h1>What is Hybridfox?</h1>

<p>Hybridfox is a Firefox add-on that attempts to get the best of popular public and private Cloud Computing environments. Currently it supports <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a>, <a href="http://open.eucalyptus.com/%20Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, <a href="http://opennebula.org/">OpenNebula</a> and <a href="http://hpcloud.com/">HP Cloud</a> environments. The idea is to use a tool providing a single interface to switch seamlessly between multiple cloud accounts in order to manage your "Cloud Computing" environment. It offers complete GUI for Amazon Web Services like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Elastic Load Balancer</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/">CloudWatch</a>, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/">Spot Instances</a> and <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>. </p>

<p>It is also localized in Japanese and Chinese languages with the help of community support</p>

<h1>What can Hybridfox do?</h1>

<p>Hybridfox can help you to do everything that you could possibly do with Elasticfox, on the Eucalyptus Computing environment</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage Images</li>
<li>Raise and Stop Instances</li>
<li>Manage Instances</li>
<li>Manage Elastic IPs</li>
<li>Manage Security Groups</li>
<li>Manage Key-pairs</li>
<li>Manage Elastic Block Storage</li>
</ul><h1>Who are the creators?</h1>

<p>Developers at CSS Corp R&amp;D Labs are the creators and maintainers of Hybridfox, <em>With a great deal of contribution from the Community</em>. Hybridfox is primarily forked from Elasticfox to be able to work amicably with Eucalyptus.</p>

<p>CSS Corp Labs is also proud to present their other tools and services. Please check out the following tools and services, and provide your feedback.</p>

<h1>Why this Project?</h1>

<p>There something about the Elasticfox development that restricts it only to EC2 environment. But Manoj (the maintainer of Elasticfox) has done well to keep it open source, so that people like us could just take it further, and hence this project.</p>

<p>It would be nice if the community gets involved and extends this a little further.</p>

<p><em>Caveat:</em> Hybridfox is an extension of an earlier version of Elasticfox, 1.6.x.</p>

<h1>All About the Versions</h1>

<p>Hybridfox development is more focused on supporting all features of popular Private Cloud frameworks without breaking the EC2 functionality.</p>

<h2>1.7! Whats that?</h2>

<p>Thanks to David Kavanagh, from Eucalyptus Inc. We are out with 1.7, hybridfox, with all the features of Hybridfox and the latest of features of Elasticfox. Apart from that he has also included some cool features like.</p>

<ul>
<li>Specifying an Endpoint(Region) as Eucalytpus or not</li>
<li>Defining a Default account for a particular region</li>
<li>Support for latest AWS Signing convention(which is also the Eucalyptus Enterprise's convention)</li>
</ul><p>Please feel free to, Download, Play and Rant in of any issues.</p>

<h2>1.6 &amp; 1.7 - Japanese</h2>

<p>Thanks Ryo Watanabe for localizing Hybridfox to Japanese </p>

<h2>1.6 - Simplified Chinese</h2>

<p>Thanks Punkboyee for localizing Hybridfox to Simplified Chinese</p>

<h1>Original Readme</h1>

<p>This is a Mozilla Firefox extension for interacting with Amazon EC2. The source code
also functions as an example of how to use the Amazon EC2 Query API from
JavaScript.</p>

<h2>Usage:</h2>

<p>The extension can be installed by opening the .xpi file contained in the archive that includes
this README file. Alternatively, the latest version of the .xpi file is hosted in Amazon
S3 at the following URL:</p>

<p><a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2ui.xpi">http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2ui.xpi</a></p>

<p>If you visit the link above using Mozilla Firefox you will be prompted regarding the
installation of the extension.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>

<p>This extension requires Mozilla Firefox version 1.5.0 or later.</p>

<h2>Source Code:</h2>

<p>The full source code is available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/elasticfox/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/elasticfox/</a></p>

<p>The .xpi file is really just a renamed ZIP archive. Your garden variety ZIP utilities can be 
used to unzip it. Within this archive you will find a file named ec2ui.jar. This is also just
a renamed JAR archive so you can explore it in the same way. This JAR file contains the bulk
of the interesting source code. Highlights include:</p>

<p>content/ec2ui/client.js
    This file contains the logic to construct and sign requests to Amazon EC2.</p>

<p>content/ec2ui/controller.js
    This file wraps client.js and includes logic to unpack Amazon EC2 responses.</p>
