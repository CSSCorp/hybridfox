# What is Hybridfox?

Hybridfox is a Firefox add-on that attempts to get the best of popular public and private Cloud Computing environments. Currently it supports [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), [Eucalyptus](http://open.eucalyptus.com/ Eucalyptus), [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/), [OpenNebula](http://opennebula.org/) and [HP Cloud](http://hpcloud.com/) environments. The idea is to use a tool providing a single interface to switch seamlessly between multiple cloud accounts in order to manage your "Cloud Computing" environment. It offers complete GUI for Amazon Web Services like [Elastic Load Balancer](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/), [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/), [Spot Instances](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot-instances/) and [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). 

It is also localized in Japanese and Chinese languages with the help of community support

# Why this Project?

There something about the Elasticfox development that restricts it only to EC2 environment. But Manoj (the maintainer of Elasticfox) has done well to keep it open source, so that people like us could just take it further, and hence this project.

It would be nice if the community gets involved and extends this a little further.

*Caveat:* Hybridfox is an extension of an earlier version of Elasticfox, 1.6.x.

# Original Readme

This is a Mozilla Firefox extension for interacting with Amazon EC2. The source code
also functions as an example of how to use the Amazon EC2 Query API from
JavaScript.

## Usage:

The extension can be installed by opening the .xpi file contained in the archive that includes
this README file. Alternatively, the latest version of the .xpi file is hosted in Amazon
S3 at the following URL:

  http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2-downloads/ec2ui.xpi

If you visit the link above using Mozilla Firefox you will be prompted regarding the
installation of the extension.

## Prerequisites:

This extension requires Mozilla Firefox version 1.5.0 or later.

## Source Code:

The full source code is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/elasticfox/

The .xpi file is really just a renamed ZIP archive. Your garden variety ZIP utilities can be 
used to unzip it. Within this archive you will find a file named ec2ui.jar. This is also just
a renamed JAR archive so you can explore it in the same way. This JAR file contains the bulk
of the interesting source code. Highlights include:

  content/ec2ui/client.js
    This file contains the logic to construct and sign requests to Amazon EC2.

  content/ec2ui/controller.js
    This file wraps client.js and includes logic to unpack Amazon EC2 responses.
